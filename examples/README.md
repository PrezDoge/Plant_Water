## Examples

This folder contains example sketches for testing individual components:

- `sensor_calibration.ino` - Calibrate moisture sensors and determine proper thresholds
- `pump_test.ino` - Test the H-Bridge motor control without sensors

### Usage

1. Open any example in Arduino IDE
2. Upload to your RedBoard
3. Follow the serial monitor instructions
4. Use results to configure main system sketches

### sensor_calibration.ino
Use this to find the right threshold values for your specific soil type and sensors.

### pump_test.ino  
Test your motor/pump setup before connecting sensors.
